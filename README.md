# Raspberry Pi Surveillence Camera Setup (Headless)

This guide sets up a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or similar Pi with a CSI camera) to automatically record or stream video from boot.

It assumes:

Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Bookworm or newer)

Headless setup (SSH only, no GUI)

Official Raspberry Pi Camera Module or compatible (in this I'm using the )

## Flash Raspberry Pi OS

Download Raspberry Pi Imager
Select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit).

Configure advanced settings:
    Enable SSH
    Set username/password
    Configure WiFi (SSID + password + country)
    Set hostname (e.g., pi-cam-01)

Flash to microSD and boot the Pi.

### Setup:
`ssh pi@pi-cam-01.local`
(or use the Piâ€™s IP address)

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

verify has rpicam:
`which rpicam-still` should return something.

`sudo apt install -y ffmpeg v4l-utils git motion vim` (vim is optional but I prefer it)

Edit `/boot/firmware/config.txt` with `sudo vim /boot/firmware/config.txt` (see here: https://docs.arducam.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera/Native-camera/12MP-IMX708/)
    change `camera_auto_detect=1` to `camera_auto_detect=0`
    Locate the line [all] and add the following line below it:
        `dtoverlay=imx708` (you may need it to be different depending on what camera you have. Check out the arducam docs for more info)
    reboot with `sudo reboot`

check that it recognied the camera with `rpicam-still --list-cameras`
test with `rpicam-hello -t 5000`

### Set up for recording:

Clone this repo into the rpi: `git clone https://github.com/jstephencorey/rpi-surveillence.git`
Go into it with `cd rpi-surveillence`
Make the setup file runnable with `chmod +x setup.sh capture.py motion_postprocess.py`
Run the setup `sudo ./setup.sh`
reboot with `sudo reboot`
